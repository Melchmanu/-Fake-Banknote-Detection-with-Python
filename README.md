# -Fake-Banknote-Detection-with-Python
This project focuses on detecting counterfeit banknotes using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains features extracted from genuine and forged banknotes, and the goal is to classify the notes as either authentic or fake.

## Overview  
1. **Machine Learning Techniques Used**:  
   - Linear Regression  
   - K-Means Clustering  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Gradient Boosting  
   - Random Forest  

2. **Applications**:  
   - A detailed notebook explaining the algorithms and their performance.  
   - A Python-based app to detect counterfeit banknotes.  

## Files  
- **Notebook for Learning Algorithms**: Step-by-step exploration of models and their implementations.  
- **Notebook for Application**: A streamlined version to directly use the trained models for detecting fake banknotes.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or any Python IDE.  
3. Run the "Learning Algorithms" notebook to understand the approach.  
4. Use the "Application" notebook to test with your own banknote data.  

## Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
- Training and evaluating machine learning models.  
- Building an end-to-end application using Python.
