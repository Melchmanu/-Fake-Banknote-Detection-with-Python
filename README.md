# Fake Banknote Detection with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting counterfeit banknotes using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset, `billets.csv`, contains features extracted from genuine and forged banknotes (1,500 entries: 1,000 real and 500 fake). The goal is to classify the notes as either authentic or fake through supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

## Data Pipeline
The main steps of the project include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled missing values using linear regression after normalizing the data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: 
  - Applied K-Means Clustering to observe the natural distribution of clusters (using the elbow method for optimal K).
- **Supervised Learning**: 
  - Trained and evaluated four different machine learning models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Random Forest
- **Application**: 
  - Built a Python-based app to detect counterfeit banknotes using the trained models.
